# CTMRenderer
<br>

Note: This repository has been abanded in favor of my other repository CMRenderer. This is here for legacy's sake.



An initial testing project where I try to learn more about graphics programming structure through the WinAPI and DirectX11.

CTM stands for custom. I know, it's really original.

## Note: This project is a work in progress. No code is said to be final or perfect. The project is not guaranteed to be buildable.
